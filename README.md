## Mobile Applications


Welcome to **Mobile Applications** here you will find a Collection/Portfolio of Mobile Applications created with various different programming languages.



<p>
A mobile application, most commonly referred to as an app, is a type of application software designed to run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet computer. Mobile applications frequently serve to provide users with similar services to those accessed on PCs. Apps are generally small, individual software units with limited function.
